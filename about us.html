      <h2>About Amul Dairy</h2>
      <hr/>
      <ul>
      <p><li>
        Amul Dairy is a cooperative dairy company based in India, known for its
        high-quality dairy products including milk, butter, cheese, and ice
        cream. Established in 1946, it has become one of the largest dairy
        brands in India.
      </li></p>
      <p><li>
        Amul is famous for its cooperative model, which empowers farmers by
        providing them with fair prices for their milk and dairy products. The
        brand is also recognized for its innovative marketing campaigns and
        iconic
      </p>
      <p>
        representatives managed the village societies and the district union,
        The seeds of this unusual saga were sown in Anand, a small town in the
        state of Gujarat in western India. The exploitative trade practices
        followed by the local trade cartel triggered off the cooperative
        movement. Angered by unfair and manipulative practices followed by the
        trade, the farmers of the district approached the great Indian patriot
        Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel for a solution. He advised them to get rid of
        middlemen and form their own co-operative, which would have procurement,
        processing and marketing under their control.
      </li></p>
      <p><li>
        In 1946, the farmers of this area went on a milk strike refusing to be
        cowed down by the cartel. Under the inspiration of Sardar Patel, and the
        guidance of leaders like Morarji Desai and Tribhuvandas Patel, they
        formed their own cooperative in 1946.
      </li></p>
      <p><li>
        This co-operative, the Kaira District Co-operative Milk Producers Union
        Ltd. began with just two village dairy co-operative societies and 247
        litres of milk and is today better known as Amul Dairy. Amul grew from
        strength to strength thanks to the inspired leadership of Tribhuvandas
        Patel, the founder Chairman and the committed professionalism of Dr
        Verghese Kurien,who was entrusted the task of running the dairy from
        1950.
      </li></p>
      <p><li>
        The then Prime Minister of India, Lal Bahadur Shastri decided that the
        same approach should become the basis of a National Dairy Development
        policy. He understood that the success of Amul could be attributed to
        four important factors. The farmers owned the dairy, their elected they
        employed professionals to operate the dairy and manage its business.
        Most importantly, the co- operatives were sensitive to the needs of
        farmers and responsive to their demands.
      </li></p>
      <p><li>
        At his instance in 1965 the National Dairy Development Board was set up
        with the basic objective of replicating the Amul model. Dr. Kurien was
        chosen to head the institution as its Chairman and asked to replicate
        this model throughout the country.
      </li></p>
      <h2>The Amul Model</h2>
      <hr/>
      <p><li>
        The Amul Model of dairy development is a three-tiered structure with the
        dairy cooperative societies at the village level federated under a milk
        union at the district level and a federation of member unions at the
        state level.
