              <strong>Bombay:</strong> Summer of 1967. A Charni Road flat. Mrs.
              Sheela Mane, a 28-year-old housewife is out in the balcony drying
              clothes. From her second floor flat she can see her neighbours on
              the road. There are other people too. The crowd seems to be
              growing larger by the minute. Unable to curb her curiosity Sheela
              Mane hurries down to see what all the commotion is about. She
              expects the worst but can see no signs of an accident. It is her
              four-year-old who draws her attention to the hoarding that has
              come up overnight. "It was the first Amul hoarding that was put up
              in Mumbai," recalls Sheela Mane. "People loved it. I remember it
              was our favourite topic of discussion for the next one week!
              Everywhere we went somehow or the other the campaign always seemed
              to crop up in our conversation."
            </p>
            <p>
              Call her the Friday to Friday star. Round eyed, chubby cheeked,
              winking at you, from strategically placed hoardings at many
              traffic lights. She is the Amul moppet everyone loves to love
              (including prickly votaries of the Shiv Sena and BJP). How often
              have we stopped, looked, chuckled at the Amul hoarding that casts
              her sometime as the coy, shy Madhuri, a bold sensuous Urmila or
              simply as herself, dressed in her little polka dotted dress and a
              red and white bow, holding out her favourite packet of butter.
            </p>
            <p>
              For 30 odd years the Utterly Butterly girl has managed to keep her
              fan following intact. So much so that the ads are now ready to
              enter the
              <em>Guinness Book of World Records</em> for being the longest
              running campaign ever. The ultimate compliment to the butter came
              when a British company launched a butter and called it Utterly
              Butterly, last year.
            </p>
            <p>
              It all began in 1966 when Sylvester daCunha, then the managing
              director of the advertising agency, ASP, clinched the account for
              Amul butter. The butter, which had been launched in 1945, had a
              staid, boring image, primarily because the earlier advertising
              agency which was in charge of the account preferred to stick to
              routine, corporate ads.

            </p>
            <p>
              In India, food was something one couldn't afford to fool around
              with. It had been taken too seriously, for too long. Sylvester
              daCunha decided it was time for a change of image.
            </p>
            <p>
              The year Sylvester daCunha took over the account, the country saw
              the birth of a campaign whose charm has endured fickle public
              opinion, gimmickry and all else.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Amul girl who lends herself so completely to Amul butter,
              created as a rival to the Polson butter girl. This one was sexy,
              village belle, clothed in a tantalising <em>choli</em> all but
              covering her upper regions. "Eustace Fernandez (the art director)
              and I decided that we needed a girl who would worm her way into a
              housewife's heart. And who better than a little girl?" says
              Sylvester daCunha. And so it came about that the famous Amul
              Moppet was born.
            </p>
            <p>
              That October, lamp kiosks and the bus sites of the city were
              splashed with the moppet on a horse. The baseline simply said,
              Thoroughbread, Utterly Butterly Delicious Amul,. It was a matter
              of just a few hours before the daCunha office was ringing with
              calls. Not just adults, even children were calling up to say how
              much they had liked the ads. "The response was phenomenal,"
              recalls Sylvester daCunha. "We knew our campaign was going to be
              successful."
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center">
              <img
                style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto"
                src="story3.png"

            </p>
            <p>
              For the first one year the ads made statements of some kind or the
              other but they had not yet acquired the topical tone. In 1967,
              Sylvester decided that giving the ads a solid concept would give
              them extra mileage, more <em>dum</em>, so to say. It was a
              decision that would stand the daCunhas in good stead in the years
              to come.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 1969, when the city first saw the beginning of the Hare Rama
              Hare Krishna movement, Sylvester daCunha, Mohammad Khan and Usha
              Bandarkar, then the creative team working on the Amul account came
              up with a clincher -- 'Hurry Amul, Hurry Hurry'. Bombay reacted to
              the ad with a fervour that was almost as devout as the Iskon
              fever.
            </p>
            <p>
              That was the first of the many topical ads that were in the
              offing. From then on Amul began playing the role of a social
              observer. Over the years the campaign acquired that all important
              Amul touch.
            </p>
            <p>
              India looked forward to Amul's evocative humour. If the Naxalite
              movement was the happening thing in Calcutta, Amul would be up
              there on the hoardings saying, "Bread without Amul Butter,
              <em>cholbe na cholbe na</em> (won't do, won't do). If there was an
              Indian Airlines strike Amul would be there again saying, Indian
              Airlines Won't Fly Without Amul.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are stories about the butter that people like to relate over
              cups of tea. "For over 10 years I have been collecting Amul ads. I
              especially like the ads on the backs of the butter packets, "says
              Mrs. Sumona Varma. What does she do with these ads? "I have made
              an album of them to amuse my grandchildren," she laughs. "They are
              almost part of our culture, aren't they? My grandchildren are
              already beginning to realise that these ads are not just a source
              of amusement. They make them aware of what is happening around
              them."
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite some of the negative reactions that the ads have got,
              DaCunhas have made it a policy not to play it safe. There are
              numerous ads that are risque in tone.
            </p>
            <p>
              "We had the option of being sweet and playing it safe, or making
              an impact. A fine balance had to be struck. We have a campaign
              that is strong enough to make a statement. I didn't want the
              hoardings to be pleasant or tame. They have to say something,"
              says Rahul daCunha.
            </p>
            <p>
              "We ran a couple of ads that created quite a furore," says
              Sylvester daCunha. "The Indian Airlines one really angered the
              authorities. They said if they didn't take down the ads they would
              stop supplying Amul butter on the plane. So ultimately we
              discontinued the ad," he says laughing. Then there was the time
              when the Amul girl was shown wearing the Gandhi cap. The high
              command came down heavy on that one. The Gandhi cap was a symbol
              of independence, they couldn't have anyone not taking that
              seriously. So despite their reluctance the hoardings were wiped
              clean. "Then there was an ad during the Ganpati festival which
              said, Ganpati Bappa More Ghya (Ganpati Bappa take more). The Shiv
              Sena people said that if we didn't do something about removing the
              ad they would come and destroy our office. It is surprising how
              vigilant the political forces are in this country. Even when the
              Enron ads (Enr On Or Off) were running, Rebecca Mark wrote to us
              saying how much she liked them."

            <p>
              There were other instances too. Heroine Addiction, Amul's little
              joke on Hussain had the artist ringing the daCunhas up to request
              them for a blow up of the ad. "He said that he had seen the
              hoarding while passing through a small district in UP. He said he
              had asked his assistant to take a photograph of himself with the
              ad because he had found it so funny," says Rahul daCunha in amused
              tones. Indians do have a sense of humour, afterall.
            </p>
            <p>
              From the Sixties to the Nineties, the Amul ads have come a long
              way. While most people agree that the Amul ads were at their peak
              in the Eighties they still maintain that the Amul ads continue to
              tease a laughter out of them.
            </p>
            <p>
              Where does Amul's magic actually lie? Many believe that the charm
              lies in the catchy lines. That we laugh because the humour is what
              anybody would enjoy. They don't pander to your nationality or
              certain sentiments. It is pure and simple, everyday fun.
